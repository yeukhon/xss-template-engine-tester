## Test suite for Python template engines against XSS

This is a lame test suite to test Python template engines against XSS.

The detail can be found in [Gist: Security TODO](https://gist.github.com/yeukhon/22f2a21cd376c002c270).

## Usage

As simple as ``phantomjs test.js http://localhost:8000/output/0_0_django.html``.
